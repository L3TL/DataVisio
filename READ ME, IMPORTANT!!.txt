To start off, first place your dataset file that you wish to see in the data
folder. Remember that this dataset file needs to be of a .JSON or .GEXF format.

Then, enter the config.json file (open it with some text editor or anything to see its insides)
In the "data" line, change the directory to your file. (so if your file is A.json, and it is
in the data folder, type in "data/A.json".

Save your changes, then run the 'index.html' file to visualize your file! (Must be via Mozilla Firefox)
